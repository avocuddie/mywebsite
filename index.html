        <h2>Research Experience</h2>

        <h3>Undergraduate Researcher at UCI Particle Physics, Professor Ochoa</h3>
        <p>June 2022 - May 2023</p>
        <p>Contributed to a project focused on the search for Lorentz invariance violation in neutrino oscillations. This involved using ROOT, a C++ data analysis framework, to develop and apply object-oriented programming techniques to analyze eight years of data from the Daya Bay experiment. Implemented cuts for data selection criteria and utilized ROOT's built-in statistical analysis tools to identify and eliminate background noise from the data. Collaborated with the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) to run analysis on high-performance computing clusters.</p>
